# NOTE: This repository is no longer under active development.

I don't use Phaser anymore and I am not tracking its development. However, I am willing to build the docset if you submit a pull request with the phaser module updated to the latest version tag.

phaser-dash-docset
==================

A Dash Docset for Phaser.

### Get the Docset

The Phaser docset is now hosted through the Dash user contributions. You can download it in Phaser by going to Preferences > Downloads > User Contributed.

### Build the Docset

After downloading the repository, the following commands will build and compress the docset.

```

> ./run.sh
```
